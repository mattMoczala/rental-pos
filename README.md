# rentalAPI

## What's this project about?

This is a project developed for bike rental company. Works somewhat like POS system, but since it's a web-app
it doesn't connect with fiscal printers.

It's goal is like any other business app - to optimize processes.
Provides users with interface to:
- monitor ongoing rentals
- monitor aviable items for rental (not yet rented)
- rent aviable items
- browse rental history
- CRUD client DB
- ...and few others not listed here


## Why web-app and MERN stack?

It was essential for business owner to have an app optimized both for mobile and desktop (that's why web),
also there are multiple cashiers that serve customers and their devices need to be in sync to monitor aviable items (that's why
dynamic JS library like React).


## Features that are likely to be implemented in future:

- connection with fiscal devices over local network.
